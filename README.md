For Demo Testing 
 1. Deploy a stack in your AWS account using the template (No need to do this again if done once and that stack isn't deleted). There are two ways to do this:
    1. Use AWS [console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks)
    2. Login to aws through CLI, then run this command 
 3. Run `aws configure` to setup your AWS account (in default profile)
 4. Press `Ctrl+Shift+p` to open VS Code command palette
 5. Run `Cloudfix-linter: init` command
 6. Save/Edit template file to show recommendations
